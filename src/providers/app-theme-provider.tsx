/**
 * A root-level React Provider component designed to apply the custom WSO2 Oxygen UI theme
 * to an application.
 *
 * It uses Oxygen UI's `extendTheme` utility to:
 * 1. Set the global typography font family to 'Inter'.
 * 2. Define distinct 'light' and 'dark' color schemes with specific palette customizations,
 * such as the primary main color and various background and font colors for the 'light' mode.
 *
 * This theme is then provided to the component tree via the Oxygen UI's `ThemeProvider`,
 * allowing all descendant components to access the custom design tokens.
